# Example for performing LIV Sweeps Using the SpikeSafe SMU and a Spectrometer

The sequence is in preparation to be released in SpikeSafePythonSamples version 1.3.0. In this sequence, we will address how to integrate a SpikeSafe SMU or PRF into a light measurement system. From there, we will demonstrate how to easily perform LIV Sweeps using the SpikeSafe's Pulsed Sweep operation mode.
