# SpikeSafe Python Samples

Use these code samples to start learning how to communicate with your SpikeSafe via TCP/IP using Python. Sequences can be run with the following Vektrex products:
 - [SpikeSafe SMU](https://www.vektrex.com/products/spikesafe-source-measure-unit/)
 - [SpikeSafe Performance Series ("PRF")](https://www.vektrex.com/products/spikesafe-performance-series-precision-pulsed-current-sources/)

## Directory

- \Getting Started - These sequences are primarily intended for first-time users of Vektrex products. They contain steps to perform the basic tasks that are necessary to run the sequences within SpikeSafePythonExamples/Instrument Examples.
  - \Read IDN
  - \Read All Events
  - \Read Memory Table Data
- \Instrument Examples - These folders contain examples to run specific SpikeSafe modes. Basic settings will be sent to the SpikeSafe, and then one or more channels will be enabled to demonstrate the operation of each mode.
  - \Run Bias
  - \Run Bias Pulsed
  - \run_dc
  - \Run Modulated DC
  - \Run Multi Pulse
  - \Run Pulsed Sweep
  - \Run Pulsed
  - \Run Single Pulse
- [Application Specific Examples](/Application-Specific%20Examples) - These folders consist of more advanced sequences to address specific test scenarios, as well as some demonstrations to fine-tune your SpikeSafe current output.
