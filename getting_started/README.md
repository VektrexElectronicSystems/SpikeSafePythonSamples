# Getting Started

These sequences are primarily intended for first-time users of Vektrex products. They contain steps to perform the basic tasks that are necessary to run the sequences within SpikeSafePythonExamples/Instrument Examples.

## Contents

 - **ReadAllEvents.py:** Reads all events from the SpikeSafe event queue
 - **ReadIdnExpanded.py:** Uses the SCPI Standard "*IDN?" query to obtain the model your SpikeSafe
 - **TcpSample.py:** a more in depth example that connects to the SpikeSafe using a TCP socket. An *IDN? query is sent with more verbose Python commands.
