# Instrument Examples

These folders contain examples to run specific SpikeSafe modes. Basic settings will be sent to the SpikeSafe, and then one or more channels will be enabled to demonstrate the operation of each mode. Each folder contains information on the relevant settings and expected output from the given mode(s). Certain modes will only be available for specific SpikeSafe models.
